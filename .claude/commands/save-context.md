can you give a detailed summary of everything so far? Your context is about to run out, so I need you to give me a prompt that will help you continue from where we left off and remind you of all the current to-do list that you have and any problems and issues.

Your prompt should include using the 500 chunk line method to read the entirety of the voice-shopper-saas file, project_structure file and error_log and INITIAL.md file file because those are ever so vital every time context is lost. So that you can get 100% context of what's going on and that all your implementation of code and changes to everything are correct and up-to-date based on what's actually happening. So you don't end up creating the wrong files or doing things that's already been done. Also the main prp was created based off INITIAL.md and sometimes the main prp misses the nuanaces, functionality and business requirements of initial.md so its important to read ALL these files. Initial md is 150 lines so can be read in one go. It's just to keep the whole project cohesive. Do you understand what I'm asking? this propmpt really needs as much context as possible as well as correctly guiding you(after reset) how to get back to what we was doing, smoothly without brain loss.

in needs to be writen in a way i can just copy and paste and you know how to continue. It should start with "The entire prompt/message to send me to remind me what we're doing"

also the last line should be your very first task is to update your TODOs and then ask for my approval (I will review your todos). so in your To-dos when it comes to the reading sections for the 500 chunk lines that need to be applied to any file that needs reading. There needs to be a bold instruction to not deviate from the reading task because you often will only read half and then you stop and skip. Make sure you read the entire file before moving on to the next file to read. That needs to be made ever so clear in your to-dos. Also, in your to-dos, tell me how whatever the task is that we're currently working on is going to work and give me a confidence score. I need to see that it's relevant to the project and it fits within what we're doing. You and I need proof based on PRP, project structure, our existing code base/ database etc, and then you propose that to me and wait for my approval before we even begin. ALSO ANY TASK THAT INVOLVES READING ANY FILE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME STRICT 500 CHUNK LINE METHOD UPDATED TODO oh yeah and you need to also in your to do propose your plan to update the current project structure based on where we are based on context, summaary and what we've achieved so far. Same thing for error_logs.

te Approval Gate.
Your response will end with the phrase: "Awaiting your approval on this Plan of Action before proceeding." You will not perform any other actions until I approve your plan. Your very first task is to create the "Plan of Action" as described above and then ask for my approval.
(remember i need this all as a prompt, make sure to structure this in an easy to follow systematic way)
